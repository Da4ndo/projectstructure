# ProjectStructure

ProjectStructure is a sophisticated utility designed for analyzing and preserving your project's structure. It offers an intuitive and efficient methodology for initializing and updating your project structures. Leveraging the speed and efficiency of Rust, it delivers rapid scanning capabilities. In a benchmark test, a 17GB project folder was scanned in just 1.7 seconds. The full command execution typically takes from around 0.1 to 0.5 seconds, although this can vary based on hardware specifications and project size.

## Documentation

ProjectStructure is a highly efficient tool that leverages the power of Tokio's multi-threading to swiftly traverse through your project's directories, subdirectories, and files. It's designed to automatically extract and set the name, description, and version of your project from files like `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, or similar. In case it fails to find these details, it will resort to default values.

The application also recognizes a `.projectstructureignore` file, which you can use to specify files and directories that should be ignored during the scanning process. However, the presence of this file is not mandatory, and the application will function normally without it.
